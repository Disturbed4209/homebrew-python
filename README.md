# Overview

This repository contains formulae for [Homebrew](https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew) with a special focus on **Python** projects not yet well supported by `pip install x`.

My goal is to make the scipy-super-pack obsolete and because homebrew rocks!

## Formulae you find here
* numpy
* scipy
* _Open an issue if your favorite is missing_

## Quick Start

To install 

 * `brew tap add samueljohn/python`
 * brew install numpy
 * brew install scipy


## Method 1: Raw URL

First, grab the raw URL for the formula you want by clicking on the "raw" button. For example, the raw URL for the `scipy` formula is:

```
    https://raw.github.com/samueljohn/homebrew-python/master/scipy.rb
```

Once you know the raw URL, simply use `brew install [raw URL]`, like so:


## Method 2: Use brew-tap

```
    brew tap add samueljohn/python
    brew tap install scipy  
```


That's it!
